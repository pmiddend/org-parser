* org-parser

This is trying to be a complete org-mode parser written in [[https://kotlinlang.org/][kotlin]], to be used from Java, Kotlin or other JVM languages to parse org-mode files and extract information. We'll see how far we get.

* Features so far

Not much here yet, I will update the readme according to how far I get with this:

 - Headline parsing
 - Greater blocks, dynamic blocks
 - Drawers, property drawers
 - Footnotes
 - Affiliated Keywords
 - Active and incative timestamp parsing with repeaters and ranges
 - Clocks
 - List items
 - Planning lines
 - Babel calls
 - org tables (no table.el tables yet)
 - Comment lines
 - Fixed width lines
 - Horizontal rule lines
 - Keywords
 - LaTeX environments (no nesting support, though)
 - Export snippets
